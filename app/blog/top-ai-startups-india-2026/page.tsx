          <h2>AI Startup Trends in India for 2026</h2>
          
          <h3>Trend 1: Indic Language AI is the Moat</h3>
          <p>
            Startups building AI that works in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, and Bengali have an 
            <strong>unfair advantage</strong>. Global models (GPT-4, Claude) underperform on Indic languages. 
            Krutrim, Sarvam, and Gnani are building this moat with proprietary training data.
          </p>

          <h3>Trend 2: AI Startups Command Premium Valuations</h3>
          <p>
            AI startups in India are raising at <strong>40-60% higher valuations</strong> than non-AI peers 
            at the same revenue stage. Investors are paying for AI potential, not just current metrics.
          </p>

          <h3>Trend 3: Enterprise AI Beats Consumer AI (For Now)</h3>
          <p>
            While ChatGPT captured consumer imagination, the money in India is in <strong>enterprise AI</strong> — 
            banking automation, manufacturing quality control, retail analytics, and healthcare diagnostics. 
            Enterprise contracts provide predictable recurring revenue.
          </p>

          <h3>Trend 4: AI Talent War is Brutal</h3>
          <p>
            Senior AI/ML engineers in India command <strong>₹80 lakhs to ₹1.5 crores</strong> in total compensation. 
            Demand is 5x of supply. Startups are hiring globally (Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia) and 
            training internally to bridge the gap.
          </p>

          <h3>Trend 5: Government is a Major AI Customer</h3>
          <p>
            India&apos;s government is aggressively procuring AI for <strong>healthcare diagnostics, agricultural 
            advisory, language translation, and smart city infrastructure</strong>. Startups with government 
            contracts have stable, large-scale deployment opportunities.
          </p>

          <h2>How to Get Your AI Startup Funded in 2026</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Show proprietary data.</strong> AI models are commodity. Unique training data is the moat.</li>
            <li><strong>Demonstrate 10x improvement.</strong> Your AI must be dramatically better, cheaper, or faster than non-AI alternatives.</li>
            <li><strong>Have AI-native founders.</strong> Founding team should include at least one person with deep ML/AI expertise.</li>
            <li><strong>Focus on enterprise use cases.</strong> B2B AI startups have 3x higher success rates than consumer AI in India.</li>
            <li><strong>Build for Indian languages.</strong> Any AI that works in 10+ Indian languages has a market of 1 billion+ users.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            India&apos;s AI startup ecosystem is at an inflection point. With $920M in Q1 2026 funding, 
            government support for AI infrastructure, and 1.4 billion potential users, the opportunity 
            is massive.
          </p>
          <p>
            The winners will be startups that combine <strong>deep technical expertise with uniquely
