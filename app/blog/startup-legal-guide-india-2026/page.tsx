          <p>
            Every year, promising Indian startups fail not because of bad products or poor markets, but because of preventable legal mistakes: wrong company structure, missing co-founder agreements, FEMA violations blocking foreign investment, or labour law issues that trigger government audits.
          </p>
          <p>
            This guide is the legal foundation every Indian startup founder needs. We cover what to do, when to do it, and what to avoid — updated for India&apos;s 2026 regulatory environment.
          </p>

          <h2>Step 1: Choosing Your Company Structure</h2>
          <p>Most tech startups should incorporate as a <strong>Private Limited Company</strong> under the Companies Act, 2013. Here&apos;s why, and when to choose differently:</p>

          <div className="overflow-x-auto my-6">
            <table className="w-full border-collapse border border-border text-sm">
              <thead>
                <tr className="bg-muted">
                  <th className="border border-border p-3 text-left">Structure</th>
                  <th className="border border-border p-3 text-left">Best For</th>
                  <th className="border border-border p-3 text-left">Key Benefit</th>
                  <th className="border border-border p-3 text-left">Drawback</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                {[
                  ["Pvt. Ltd. Company", "Most tech startups", "Can issue ESOPs, raise VC", "Annual compliance costs"],
                  ["LLP", "Service businesses, consultancies", "Simple tax structure, lower compliance", "Cannot issue ESOPs, VCs won't invest"],
                  ["OPC (One Person Company)", "Solo founder, early stage", "Simple, minimal compliance", "Can't raise VC, 1 shareholder limit"],
                  ["Partnership Firm", "Traditional businesses only", "Simple setup", "Unlimited liability, no VC compatibility"],
                ].map(([s, b, k, d]) => (
                  <tr key={s}>
                    <td className="border border-border p-3 font-bold">{s}</td>
                    <td className="border border-border p-3">{b}</td>
                    <td className="border border-border p-3 text-green-700">{k}</td>
                    <td className="border border-border p-3 text-red-600">{d}</td>
                  </tr>
                ))}
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </div>

          <h3>How to Incorporate a Pvt. Ltd. in India (2026 Process)</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Apply for Director Identification Numbers (DIN)</strong> for all directors on the MCA portal</li>
            <li><strong>Apply for Digital Signature Certificates (DSC)</strong> — required for all online MCA filings</li>
            <li><strong>Reserve your company name</strong> using SPICe+ (Simplified Proforma for Incorporating Company Electronically Plus)</li>
            <li><strong>File SPICe+ form</strong> with Memorandum of Association (MoA) and Articles of Association (AoA)</li>
            <li><strong>Receive Certificate of Incorporation</strong> from MCA — typically 3–5 business days</li>
            <li><strong>Apply for PAN and TAN</strong> (auto-generated with SPICe+ since 2020)</li>
            <li><strong>Open current bank account</strong> within 180 days and file commencement of business declaration</li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>Cost:</strong> ₹6,000–15,000 (government fees) + ₹5,000–20,000 (CA/CS fees). Total: ₹11,000–35,000.</p>
          <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 7–15 days if all documents are ready.</p>

          <h2>Step 2: DPIIT Recognition — India&apos;s Startup Superpower</h2>
          <p>
            DPIIT (Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade) recognition is arguably the <strong>most valuable free benefit available to Indian startups</strong>. Benefits include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Income Tax exemption:</strong> 100% tax exemption on profits for 3 consecutive years (Section 80-IAC)</li>
            <li><strong>Angel tax exemption:</strong> Angel Tax (Section 56(2)(viib)) removed entirely for DPIIT-recognized startups since Budget 2024</li>
            <li><strong>Fast-track IP:</strong> 80% rebate on patent filing fees; accelerated examination priority</li>
            <li><strong>Government tender relaxations:</strong> Exemption from prior experience/turnover requirements for government contracts</li>
            <li><strong>Self-certification for labour laws:</strong> Exemption from 9 labour laws for first 5 years</li>
            <li><strong>Seed Fund access:</strong> Eligible for up to ₹50L from Startup India Seed Fund</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Entity must be &lt;10 years old, annual turnover &lt;₹100 crores, and working toward innovation/improvement of products/services. Apply free at startupindia.gov.in — approval typically in 2–4 weeks.</p>

          <h2>Step 3: Co-Founder Agreement — Never Skip This</h2>
          <p>
            Co-founder disputes are the #3 reason Indian startups fail. A legally-drafted co-founder agreement must cover:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Equity split and vesting schedule:</strong> Standard is 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff. No vesting = one co-founder can leave day one with 50% of the company.</li>
            <li><strong>Role definitions:</strong> Who is CEO, CTO, CPO? Who has final decision authority in each area?</li>
            <li><strong>Founder lockup:</strong> Restrictions on selling shares for 2–3 years from founding</li>
            <li><strong>IP assignment:</strong> All IP created by founders belongs to the company, not the individual founder</li>
            <li><strong>Bad leaver/good leaver provisions:</strong> What happens to unvested shares if a co-founder resigns, is fired, or dies?</li>
            <li><strong>Non-compete and non-solicit:</strong> Founders cannot start a competing company or poach employees for 2 years after exit</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Cost:</strong> ₹15,000–40,000 for a CA/lawyer-drafted agreement. The most important ₹30,000 you will ever spend.</p>

          <h2>Step 4: Setting Up ESOPs (Employee Stock Option Plans)</h2>
          <p>
            ESOPs are your most powerful talent retention tool — giving employees ownership in the company they help build. Indian startup ESOP rules:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Governed by Section 62(1)(b) of the Companies Act, 2013</li>
            <li>Must be approved by a special resolution at the Annual General Meeting</li>
            <li>Minimum 1-year vesting period required by law (most startups use 4-year with 1-year cliff)</li>
            <li>Grant price can be Fair Market Value (FMV) or a discount — discounted ESOPs are more valuable as employee benefit but have higher tax liability on exercise</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>2026 ESOP Tax Update:</strong> Unlisted company employees now pay tax only when they <em>sell</em> the shares (not when they exercise options). This was a major Budget 2024 reform that significantly increased ESOP attractiveness for startup employees.</p>

          <h2>Step 5: GST Compliance</h2>
          <p>
            Goods and Services Tax is mandatory once your annual turnover exceeds ₹40 lakhs (services: ₹20 lakhs). Key points for startups:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>GST Registration:</strong> Required within 30 days of crossing threshold. File online at gst.gov.in. Process takes 3–7 days.</li>
            <li><strong>Monthly/Quarterly Returns:</strong> GSTR-1 (outward supplies) and GSTR-3B (summary return) — must be filed even if nil sales</li>
            <li><strong>Input Tax Credit:</strong> Claim GST paid on all business expenses (office rent, software subscriptions, travel) against GST collected from customers</li>
            <li><strong>SaaS companies note:</strong> Software services are taxable at 18% GST. If selling to businesses, they can claim ITC — making your effective GST cost near zero for B2B customers</li>
            <li><strong>Export services:</strong> ZERO GST on services exported to foreign clients (treat as zero-rated supply and claim refund on input GST)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Step 6: FEMA Compliance for Foreign Investment</h2>
          <p>
            FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act) governs all foreign investment in Indian startups. Non-compliance is one of the most common — and most serious — mistakes Indian founders make.
          </p>
          <h3>Before Accepting Foreign Investment</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Ensure your sector is eligible under the Automatic Route (no RBI approval needed for most tech sectors) or get RBI approval for restricted sectors</li>
            <li>Issue shares to foreign investors within 60 days of receiving funds</li>
            <li>File FC-GPR (Form for reporting foreign investment) with RBI within 30 days of issuing shares</li>
            <li>Maintain a separate foreign currency bank account if remittances exceed $1M regularly</li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>Common mistake:</strong> Startups accept angel investment from an NRI friend without filing FC-GPR. FEMA penalty = 3x the invested amount. Always file.</p>

          <h3>FEMA and Convertible Notes</h3>
          <p>Convertible notes from foreign investors are allowed for DPIIT-recognized startups with a minimum investment of $500,000, compulsory conversion within 5 years.</p>

          <h2>Step 7: Intellectual Property Protection</h2>
          <h3>What to Protect and How</h3>
          <div className="overflow-x-auto my-6">
            <table className="w-full border-collapse border border-border text-sm">
              <thead>
                <tr className="bg-muted">
                  <th className="border border-border p-3 text-left">IP Type</th>
                  <th className="border border-border p-3 text-left">What It Covers</th>
                  <th className="border border-border p-3 text-left">Cost (India)</th>
                  <th className="border border-border p-3 text-left">Timeline</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                {[
                  ["Trademark", "Brand name, logo, tagline", "₹4,500 (small entity)", "18–36 months"],
                  ["Patent", "Technical invention or process", "₹1,600–8,800 (startup rate)", "2–5 years"],
                  ["Copyright", "Software code, content, designs", "Auto on creation; optional ₹500 registration", "Immediate"],
                  ["Trade Secret", "Proprietary algorithms, databases", "NDA + restrictive employment clauses", "Ongoing"],
                ].map(([t, c, co, ti]) => (
                  <tr key={t}>
                    <td className="border border-border p-3 font-bold">{t}</td>
                    <td className="border border-border p-3">{c}</td>
                    <td className="border border-border p-3 text-[#C59A2E]">{co}</td>
                    <td className="border border-border p-3">{ti}</td>
                  </tr>
                ))}
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </div>
          <p><strong>Critical rule:</strong> All IP must be formally assigned from individual founders/employees to the company. A verbal agreement is worthless in an IP dispute.</p>

          <h2>Step 8: Employment Law Compliance</h2>
          <p>Key employment law requirements for Indian tech startups:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Offer letter + Employment agreement:</strong> Mandatory; must include role, compensation, ESOP grant, IP assignment, NDA, and non-solicit clauses</li>
            <li><strong>Provident Fund (PF):</strong> Mandatory if 20+ employees. Employer contributes 12% of basic salary to employee PF account</li>
            <li><strong>Employee State Insurance (ESI):</strong> Mandatory for employees earning &lt;₹21,000/month (employer: 3.25%, employee: 0.75%)</li>
            <li><strong>Gratuity:</strong> Mandatory after 5 years of continuous service — 15 days pay per year of service</li>
            <li><strong>POSH compliance:</strong> Prevention of Sexual Harassment Act — mandatory Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) for organizations with 10+ employees. Non-compliance = criminal liability for employer</li>
          </ul>

          <blockquote>
            <p>&ldquo;Legal compliance is not a burden — it&apos;s a moat. A clean legal structure, clean cap table, and clean IP assignment make due diligence fast, build investor trust, and prevent the catastrophic legal disputes that end promising companies.&rdquo; — Nikhil Bharadwaj, Partner, Khaitan & Co</p>
          </blockquote>

          <h2>5 Legal Mistakes That Kill Indian Startups</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>No vesting on co-founder equity:</strong> If a co-founder leaves early, they walk away with a large equity stake that will terrify every future investor</li>
            <li><strong>Missing FEMA filings:</strong> Every foreign investment not reported to RBI within 30 days is a FEMA violation — penalties are severe</li>
            <li><strong>IP created by freelancers without assignment:</strong> Work created by freelancers belongs to the freelancer unless explicitly assigned in writing</li>
            <li><strong>Not maintaining statutory registers:</strong> Minutes of meetings, register of members, register of charges — non-maintenance = MCA penalty + reputational damage</li>
            <li><strong>ESOPs without board/shareholder approval:</strong> Granting ESOPs verbally or informally without proper resolutions makes them legally unenforceable</li>
          </ol>
